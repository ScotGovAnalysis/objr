There are a few extra steps required to use this package if your Objective Connect workspace has two factor authentication (2FA) enabled. (Note: this is sometimes also referred to as 'two step verification'.)

## How does two factor authentication (2FA) work?

Where workspaces have 2FA enabled, users cannot use the API unless they have been given permission to bypass this. Permission to bypass 2FA is given at a workspace level, and can only be granted by the workspace owner.

Firstly, permission must be given at a workgroup level to allow bypassing permissions to be granted for workspaces within it. This can be done using `allow_bypass_2fa()`.

Once this has been allowed, bypassing can be granted for individual participants in a workspace using `participant_bypass_2fa()`. 

Both of these functions also allow for bypassing to be disallowed using `allow_bypass = FALSE`.

To check the status of bypassing 2FA for participants in a workspace, use `participants()`.
