## What is the difference between users and participants?

A user is an individual using Objective Connect. A participant is a user in a particular workspace. For example, a person using Objective Connect will have a User UUID associated with them, and also a Participant UUID for each individual workspace they are a member of. 

A user can get their User UUID by running `my_user_id()`. A user can find their participant UUID for a particular workspace using `participants()`.


## Can I use the objr package to interact with eRDM?

Unfortunately, no. Although both eRDM and Connect are [Objective](https://www.objective.co.uk/) products, their API's are considerably different. The objr package currently works for Objective Connect only, although it may be developed in the future to work with eRDM.
