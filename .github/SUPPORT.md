# Getting help with objr

Thanks for using objr!

## Try these first

* If you want to find out more about any of objr's functions; help files can be 
found on the [References](https://ScotGovAnalysis.github.io/objr/reference) page 
of the package website. Alternatively, type `?function_name` into the RStudio 
console. For example:

   ``` r
   ?workspaces()
   ```

* Read package guidance articles if you need help with 
[API authentication](https://scotgovanalysis.github.io/objr/articles/authentication.html) 
or 
[two-factor authentication](https://scotgovanalysis.github.io/objr/articles/two-factor.html). 

* Consult the 
[Objective Connect API documentation](https://secure.objectiveconnect.co.uk/publicapi/1/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=/publicapi/1/v3/api-docs/swagger-config#/) 
for more details on available endpoints.


## Where to ask for help

* If it's a question: Ask the Scottish Government 
[R Yammer community](https://web.yammer.com/main/groups/eyJfdHlwZSI6Ikdyb3VwIiwiaWQiOiI2MzQ4MzE2NjczIn0).
  
* If it's a bug: [file an issue](https://github.com/ScotGovAnalysis/objr/issues/new) 
on GitHub.  
  
* If you're not sure or aren't comfortable with either of these options, contact 
the [package maintainers](https://ScotGovAnalysis.github.io/objr/authors.html#authors).

Before opening a new issue, be sure to 
[search issues and pull requests](https://github.com/ScotGovAnalysis/objr/issues) 
to make sure the bug hasn't been reported and/or already fixed in the 
development version. 
By default, the search will be pre-populated with `is:issue is:open`. You can 
[edit the qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/) 
(e.g. `is:pr`, `is:closed`) as needed. For example, you'd simply remove 
`is:open` to search **all** issues in the repo, open or closed.


## How to ask for help

Try to explain your problem as clearly as possible. This could involve 
explaining what you are trying to do and what the expected and actual behaviour 
of your code is. 

It can be very useful to include a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample (reprex) 
using the [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package. For help using 
reprex, see the [Get help](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) section of the 
tidyverse site.

Being able to reproduce your problem greatly increases the chances of us being 
able to help you.
