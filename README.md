objr aims to provide a convenient method of interacting with [Objective Connect](https://secure.objectiveconnect.co.uk) using R, making use of the [Objective Connect API](https://secure.objectiveconnect.co.uk/publicapi/1/swagger-ui/index.html).

## Installation

If you are working within the Scottish Government network, you can
install objr in the same way as with other R packages. The easiest way to do this is by using the [pkginstaller](https://github.com/ScotGovAnalysis/pkginstaller/tree/main) add-in. Further guidance is available on [eRDM](https://erdm.scotland.gov.uk:8443/documents/A42404229/details).

Alternatively, objr can be installed directly from GitHub. Note that this method requires the remotes package and may not work from within the Scottish Government network.

``` r
remotes::install_github(
  "ScotGovAnalysis/objr",
  upgrade = "never",
  build_vignettes = TRUE
)
```

Finally, objr can also be installed by downloading the [zip of the
repository](https://github.com/ScotGovAnalysis/objr/archive/main.zip)
and running the following code, replacing the section marked `<>`
(including the arrows themselves) with the location of the downloaded
zip:

``` r
remotes::install_local(
  "<FILEPATH OF ZIPPED FILE>/objr-main.zip",
  upgrade = "never",
  build_vignettes = TRUE
)
```
