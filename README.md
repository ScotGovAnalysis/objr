objr aims to provide a convenient method of interacting with [Objective Connect](https://secure.objectiveconnect.co.uk) using R, making use of the [Objective Connect API](https://secure.objectiveconnect.co.uk/publicapi/1/swagger-ui/index.html).

## Installation

The package can be installed directly from GitHub. 
Note that this method requires the `remotes` package and may not work from within the Scottish Government network.

``` r
remotes::install_github(
  "ScotGovAnalysis/objr",
  upgrade = "never",
  build_vignettes = TRUE
)
```

Finally, the package can also be installed by downloading the [zip of the
repository](https://github.com/ScotGovAnalysis/objr/archive/main.zip)
and running the following code, replacing the section marked `<>`
(including the arrows themselves) with the location of the downloaded
zip:

``` r
remotes::install_local(
  "<FILEPATH OF ZIPPED FILE>/objr-main.zip",
  upgrade = "never",
  build_vignettes = TRUE
)
```
